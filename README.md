# Setup

- run `yarn` or `npm i` to install packages
- run `yarn start` or `npm start`

# Tests
- run tests with `yarn run cypress`

# Notes
- No reason to hide the `.env` as the `coingeko` api is open to all
- No state management used as the application is small. it is however built with scaling taken into account
- Opted for `mui` to minimize time spent on css
- I wrote cypress tests as that is what you use but I'm comfortable with all types of tests
